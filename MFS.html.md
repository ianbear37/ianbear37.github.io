## Map

I was raised in Kaohsiung, a city whose name is same as Takao in Japan.
I graduate from National Chung Hsing University. In senior years, I exchanged to Hokkaido University, probably the most beautiful university in Japan.
I currently work in Mega Bank as a normal bank teller.
Now, I am an old student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

## Smiles
Watching Anime and maga are my favorite activities. Besides, I also like to search some good cosmetic products every year and theirs ingredients.
Last, I am absolutely cat slave.
